Project Description
This project is a web application built with Next.js that offers several text manipulation tools, including jumbling and counting words. It also features the ability to perform a specific count for any word or letter you input.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Tired of perfectly sensible and legible paragraphs? Do you find neatly structured sentences to be a boring waste of time? We solved the non-existent problem of having too much order in your text!

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Our solution is a one-stop app for complete text chaos! Just paste your text, and we'll jumble it up for you. We'll also give you a sarcastic word count so you know just how much perfect text you've destroyed.
